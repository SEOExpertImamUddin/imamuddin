<h3>Why a portfolio is important?</h3>
<p>Ok, let me say something about the importance of a portfolio.
Portfolios are a great way to demonstrate the competencies you would list on a resume or talk about in
an interview — they allow you to show and not just tell. During a job search, the portfolio showcases
your work to potential employers. It presents evidence of your relevant skills and abilities.</p>
