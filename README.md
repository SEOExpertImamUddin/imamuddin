<h3>Why a portfolio is important?</h3>
<p>Ok, let me say something about the importance of a portfolio.
Portfolios are a great way to demonstrate the competencies you would list on a resume or talk about in
an interview â€” they allow you to show and not just tell. During a job search, the portfolio showcases
your work to potential employers. It presents evidence of your relevant skills and abilities.</p>

investments or samples of completed works. An example of a portfolio is a briefcase. An example of a
portfolio is an individualâ€™s various investments. An example of a portfolio is an artistâ€™s display of past
